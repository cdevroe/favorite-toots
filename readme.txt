Add a list of your favorite toots from Mastodon to any page on your website using a block.

== Description ==

Use the Favorite Toots block to quickly add a list of your favorite toots from Mastodon to any page on your website. The toots appear as a fully styled list. You can see how it looks by [viewing my favorite toots on my website](https://cdevroe.com/favorite-toots).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does this plugin exist? =

By default Mastodon does not expose an account's favorite toots. By using this plugin, you're able to share your favorite toots on your website.

= How do I determine my Mastodon instance URL? =

Your Mastodon instance URL is usually the domain name that appears in your username. For example, my Mastodon username is [@cdevroe@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@cdevroe) so my instance URL is mastodon.social.

= Where do I get an Mastodon API key? =

1. Log into your Mastodon instance.
2. Click Preferences > Development
3. Choose "New application"
4. Application name: Favorite Toots WordPress (or, anything you'd like)
5. Application Website: Your website URL
6. Redirect URI: (leave as-is)
7. Scopes: read:bookmarks read:favourites read:statuses
8. Click Save.
9. Copy and paste your "Access Token" into the settings of the Favorite Toots plugin at Settings > Favorite Toots.

= Where can I provide feedback? =

I welcome feedback, code, and feature suggestions! You can submit a thread to the WordPress Support Forums or [on GitHub](https://github.com/cdevroe/favorite-toots) as an issue.

== About this Plugin ==

One of the primary ways I find new accounts to follow is by eavesdropping on other people’s favorites. Many platforms make favorites public but Mastodon doesn't (yet?). I wanted to show my favorite toots publicly so that people can look through them. I’m hoping you'll make your favorite toots public this way too.
